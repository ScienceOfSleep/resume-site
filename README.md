Narrowing the scope for my portfolio by splitting it up. This section is explicitly focused on job applications.

Core Beats
-

Low upkeep Gatsby site.

Show tech and design by doing.

Have fun with it.

Future Work
-

Hook up contentful, break the data structure down so there's a user friendly CMS setup if I want to monetize these.

More animation work.

Boil it down so I can sell these? Cheap and (ideally) easy gigs for friends and acquaintances.
